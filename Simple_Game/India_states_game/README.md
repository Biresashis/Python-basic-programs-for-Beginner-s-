# Deatails about India States Game

Here I will show you how to create a **India States Game** using turtle and pandas module.
In this folder I have created 3 files and all of them are connnected.
Our main file is [***main.py***](main.py) file.

**In this game you will have to guessed the name of each states and union territory. If your guessed is right then it will show the name of your guessed state in the map**

**Note** :- You should run the [**main.py**](main.py) file to start the **India States Game**.
