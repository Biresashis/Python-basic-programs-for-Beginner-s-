# Deatails about Ping Pong Game

Here I will show you how to create a Ping Pong game using turtle module.
In this folder I have created 4 files and all of them are connnected. 
Our main file is main.py file. I have imported other python files in this files (To import a file you should use  import filename).

Note :- You should run the main.py file to start the ping pong game.
