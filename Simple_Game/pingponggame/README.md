# Deatails about Ping Pong Game

Here I will show you how to create a **Ping Pong Game** using turtle module.
In this folder I have created 4 files and all of them are connnected. 
Our main file is **main.py** file. I have imported other python files in this files (To import a file you should use ***" import file_name "*** ).

**Note** :- You should run the [**main.py**](main.py) file to start the **Ping Pong Game**.
